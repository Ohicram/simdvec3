# simdvec3
A SIMD implementation of vec3 class from the beautiful tutorial RayTracingInOneWeekend

Trying to speed up the rendering of the examples from the beautiful series https://raytracing.github.io/
I tried to implement the vec3 class using SIMD.
This was my first attempt in coding using SIMD architecture, and I have probably not wrote the best code; nontheless the gain in rendering time is about 30% with my architecture.
Hope it can be useful or either improved by someone else :)
